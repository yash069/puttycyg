There are plenty of [alternatives to PuTTYcyg](http://code.google.com/p/puttycyg/issues/detail?id=68#c2).
If you are interested in taking over maintenance of the project, please contact me.

PuTTYcyg is a patched version of [PuTTY](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/) that, in addition to telnet, rlogin, ssh, and serial connections, can also be used as a local Cygwin terminal instead of the Windows console or xterm.  See [README.txt](http://puttycyg.googlecode.com/svn-history/r8/trunk/putty-0.60/windows/cthelper/README.txt) for more information.

PuTTYcyg may require a recent version of Cygwin.  The [current version (20101029)](http://puttycyg.googlecode.com/files/puttycyg-20101029.zip) supports only Cygwin 1.7.  [PuTTYcyg version 20071202](http://puttycyg.googlecode.com/files/puttycyg-20071202.zip) works well with Cygwin 1.5.

Problems?  Please [file an issue](http://code.google.com/p/puttycyg/issues) after reading the (very short) [FAQ](FAQ.md) and the (very short) [README](README.md).  PuTTYcyg is actively maintained and supported (as of 2010-11-04) so please file issues here before trying to find support somewhere else.
